# Given an array, output a new array of the product of all the other elements in the array.
# Input:  [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [24,12,8,6]

# Instead of dividing the product of all the numbers in the array by the number at a given index to get the corresponding product, we can make use of the product of all the numbers to the left and all the numbers to the right of the index. Multiplying these two individual products would give us the desired result as well.

    res = [1]*len(nums)
        lprod = 1
        rprod = 1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            res[i] *= lprod
            lprod *= nums[i]
            res[~i] *= rprod
            rprod *= nums[~i]
        return res
